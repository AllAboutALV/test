# test

collection "tags" will be displayed but the link does not work... ;(

https://allaboutalv.github.io/tags/one.html

even though i added a one.html to the collection/tags directory but even this file will not be displayed (404 file not found)

And this is also not wanted because I only want to create the `<tag>.md` file and not an html file for each tag!
I want to have on html where the docs of the clicked tag will be listed.
  How to add the selected tag as parameter?
  or do i need to generate an html file for each `<tag>.md` file?
